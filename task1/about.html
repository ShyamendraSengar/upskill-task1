    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      <strong> We wash each customer’s clothes separately.</strong>Our focus on
      hygiene is the biggest reason our laundry services are trusted by 15 lac+
      customers. Moreover, we follow all the Covid safety guidelines prescribed
      by WHO & CDC. As a precautionary measure, we also use medical grade
      disinfectants to sanitize each washing load.
    </p>
    <p>
      All our washer men at Jaipur’s stores pay attention to the garment label
      every time they process clothes and ensure
      <b>100% adherence to the instructions given on the care label.</b> It
      removes the risk of damage from our laundry services
    </p>
    <p>
      Our laundry stores in Jaipur ensure
      <b> 100% colour bleed protection in our washing process.</b> All clothes
      are tested for colour bleed before putting in machine. Any potential
      colour bleed clothes are washed separately using mild detergents.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most common issue that people face during laundry is shrinkage.
      All Tumbledry laundry stores in Jaipur use the best of chemicals, machines
      and processes to ensure <b> zero shrinkage.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      We value your trust on our laundry service. Hence, we use pro-fabric
      chemicals to preserve the fabric and colours of your clothes completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have a proprietary Whitex technology for making your white clothes
      (like shirts, kurtas and pyjamas) 3 shades brighter. Yes, our laundry
      service can make your whites new again. Combine it with our Italian steam
      ironing and intelligent packing, and you get a crisp and impeccable finish
      every time with our laundry service in Jaipur.
